# mygraph  
----

## Overview  
* This package is another version of two graph problems, MST(minimun spanning tree) and SSSP(single-source shortest-path)  
  * For MST, uses the Kruskal algoritm  
  * For SSSP, uses Dijkstra algorithm for undirected graph, and Bellman-Ford algorithm for directed graph  
  * You can learn more about them in *Tutorial.html* in vignette folder.  
----

## Backend  
  * The improvement idea is from [here](https://www.ijcsmc.com/docs/papers/July2013/V2I7201338.pdf) but including some changes.  
----

## installation  
  * install.packages('mygraph')
